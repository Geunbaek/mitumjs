/** Hi, Dear developers!
 *
 *  ProtoconNet is a mainnet project aimed at providing trust infrastructure.
 *  ISAAC, the core algorithm, was designed to be suitable for large scale data processing for
 *  practical industrial application, the versatility of which is secured for use in all fields
 *  which require blockchain technology.
 *  Moreover, its decentralized network and governance over the entire ecosystem will promote
 *  a protocol-based pure digital economy.
 *  But at the same time, we must understand: the future does not come at once.
 *  There is no correct methodology for digital transformation of offline data and values.
 *  Digital transformation of analog reality is bound to take a fairly long time,
 *  and so the early models of pure digital economy will first emerge in game industry
 *  and metaverse which was made up of pure digital data in the first place.
 *  Taking this into regard, we take game industry and metaverse as the primer of the coming
 *  digital economy and the starting point of ProtoconNet!
 *
 *  So...
 *  'mitum.js' is a sdk for you.
 *  Happy development with us!
